LyricsBox (Still Under Development)

Description:
============
A Rhythmbox lyrics viewer plugin to show lyrics Karaoke-style.

I used to be a big fan of MiniLyrics back then at Windows days.
Then After migrating to Ubuntu didn't find a good equivalent for it.
(osd-lyrics is good but not as customizable nor stable as MiniLyrics)
So i decided to write my own plugin specially for RhythmBox.

Current Status:
===============
- Load existing .lrc files from a specific directory.
- Show Lyrics synchronously with playing track in a very simple window.

TODOs:
======
Parser:
- Fix Parser problems with some .lrc files.
- Handle loading files having variations from the track name.

Fetcher:
- Implement a Lyrics Fetcher for new tracks not having existing lyrics files.

Plugin:
- Implement an options dialog to store lyrics directory path and other needed options.
- Enhance Performance if needed.

Viewer:
- More UI enhancements.
- More Customization options to the viewer.
